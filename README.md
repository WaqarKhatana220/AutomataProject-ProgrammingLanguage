# AutomataProject-ProgrammingLanguage
I built a custom programming language called YAPL (Yet Another Programming Language) using lex and yacc in python for my course Theory of Automata.

## Functionality
The language supports following features;

**Variable declaration and assignment**

**Conditional (if/else)**

**For loops**

**Struct**
