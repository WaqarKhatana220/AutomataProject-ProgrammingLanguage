I built a custom programming language called YAPL (Yet Another Programming Language) using lex and yacc in python for my course Theory of Automata.

## Functionality
The language supports following features;

**Conditionals (if/else)**

**For loops**

**Struct**

## Syntax

Print Statement:

```

```
The following data types are supported;
